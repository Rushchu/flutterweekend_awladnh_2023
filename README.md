## Structure

We implemented an unstrict clean architecture (i.e. no domain and no services layer) with presentation layer and data layer. The reason behind that is that we are a team of 5 and we wanted to support multiple simultaneous independent work across the team where each member can implement his own associated feature. In addition, we are seperating the concern of the UI and the logic code supporting seperation of concerns and scalability for future maintenance scenarios as well as adding new features.
